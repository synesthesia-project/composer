# Synesthesia Composer

This is the composer part of the synesthesia project.

## Building / Usage

The main way in which to use this project is as a chrome extension (but the
html files output in `dist/` can also be used directly).

To Build:

* Run `npm install && gulp` if you have `gulp` installed globally
* Or run `npm install && ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js`

This output of the build is put in `dist/`, and you can either open
`dist/index.html` directly in your browser, or install the `dist/` directory as
a chrome extension (which gives you more functionality such as connecting to
google play music).

## TODO list

* Replace text placeholders with icons (buttons etc...)
* Add vertical scrolling for layers
* Introduce Different types of layers
* Add spread operation for selected events (evenly spread across selection)
* Handle display of overlapping events on same layer better
* Advanced manipulation of events:
  * Manipulate event length
  * Modify event states, their values, and timestamps
  * Visualise the event states in a 2d graph in properties panel
* Save + Load json files
* Gracefully handle mismatch of media time + file time
* File/Selection Edit / Undo History
* Additional Websites for extension functionality (bandcamp, youtube, soundcloud etc...)
* MIDI Input

## Special Thanks

The style of this app has been heavily inspired by the
[Vertex Theme for GTK](https://github.com/horst3180/vertex-theme)
